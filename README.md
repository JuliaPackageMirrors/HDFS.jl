## HDFS.jl

HDFS.jl provides a wrapper over libhdfs and a julia map-reduce functionality built on top of HDFS. It is based on libhdfs.jl that was originally written by Benjamin Yang (@benyang) and part of the julia/extras. These file system APIs can be used for direct access to HDFS files. A parallel map-reduce is also provided, based on these APIs. This is currently work in progress.
